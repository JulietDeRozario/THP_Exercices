# JavaScript_exercices_THP
These are JavaScript exercices from the bootcamp The Hacking Project !

## The scripts
These are seven exercices, each of them is written on a js file (script_1.js, script_2.js, ... etc).

## How to use them
Launch index.html in your navigator, and edit the line "src = "script_1.js" to test another script.
Open the console in "inspect element" to see the execution of the script.
